Fast JPEG Thumbnail generator.
Benoit Favre <benoit.favre@lif.univ-mrs.fr>

USAGE: ./jpeg-thumbnail <infile> <outfile> <maxdim>

Requires libjpeg. It only decodes a scaled-down version
of the image before resizing it to the required size.

It works relativelly fast on non accelerated low-end arm devices.

To compile, install libjpeg development files and type:

make
